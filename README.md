# Y sub zero's Egg Roll

## Synopsis
In this game, you are given a grid of objects. Each object is represented by an emoji on the grid. Your task is to roll the eggs in the grid to a nest in the grid.  
Each nest in the grid can only fill 1 egg. Eggs will stop if they hit a filled nest or a brick. Eggs will break if they hit the pan.  

Brick = üß±  
Egg = ü•ö  
Green = üü©  
Nest = ü™π  
Done = ü™∫  
Pan = üç≥  

You are only given a set amount of moves to roll the eggs into the nests.
